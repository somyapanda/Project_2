# Project 2 - Stock Price Predictions

## Overview
Evaluation to determine which of the following three models yields the best predictive result when analyzing historical stock data.

* Neural Network
  ○ A LSTM RNN model to predict entry and exit points that might generate profitable trades
  ○ Sequential model with four layers

* Time-Series
  ○ Univariate time series modelling using ARIMA to forecast closing stock price.
  ○ Multivariate time series modelling with correlated assets and sentiment scores as dependent
variables using ARIMA.

* Decision Tree and Random Sampling 
  ○ Create a decision tree model to determine entry & exit point of the selected public equity
  ○ Determine the precision through multiple random sampling model

The key takeaway is that it is extremely difficult to predict stock returns.
